Process

- What went well?
  - I think we found a way to work separately that eventually worked. (this ended up weighting my work toward bug fixes and refactor, and your work towards initial coding of features)
- What could be improved?
  - More clear delineation of work and expectations. I found myself often not knowing what I should do next. I think Ian's suggestion of doing smaller chunks from start to finish before starting additional functionality would be good to implement next time.
  - Something that I've found challenging in most grouped projects is setting expectations for style/architecture/etc before the project starts. Everybody has their own particular way of going about things, and I think we are still learning how to adjust to new teammates each time. This can be uncomfortable and time consuming at the beginning of each project.
- What did not go well?
  - We had a lot of work in progress at any given time, which I found difficult to follow and contribute to as I often didn't know where you were at in your work.
  - The original implementation of OAuth2 ended up only partially being paired (this is due in large part to my being unavailable for much of that afternoon, woo pregnancy). I had the expectation that I would come back from the long break and we would program it out together, so when you had already branched off and completed it I was a bit thrown. 
  - I think the side effects of me being pregnant have a negative impact on group projects due to my needing many breaks and sometimes becoming overwhelmed. :(
- What feedback do you have for your teammate(s) that might help them in future projects/on the job?
  - I think you are very good at working on your own, so a good place to practice something would be more communicative and collaborative pair programming. I can struggle with this as well, and I found that working with Michael Evans was a really great way to practice pair programming. Would highly recommend :)

Communication

- What went well?
  - I think we got better at communication as the project went along.
- What could be improved?
  - More communication at the beginning of the project would have helped me greatly.
- What did not go well?
  - I fell off of slack on the weekend without notice.
  - I would have appreciated more frequent updates about where you were in your work, especially at EOD.
- What feedback do you have for your teammate(s) that might help them in future projects/on the job?
  - At least for me, I think erring on the side of over communciation at the beginning of a project would be good to practice. It seems easier to tone down the communication than ramp it over, and clarity really helps a project move along. One thing I learned is that I would benefit from communicating that to future teammates!

Other

- I *really* appreciated your thoughtful response to my message about being overwhelmed after the weekend. It made me feel like I was in a safe environment, and it helped me get back on track. Thank you!
