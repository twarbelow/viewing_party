Process

- What went well?
  - I think we found a way to work separately that eventually worked. (this ended up weighting my work toward bug fixes and refactor, and your work towards initial coding of features)
- What could be improved?
  - More clear delineation of work and expectations. I found myself often not knowing what I should do next. I think Ian's suggestion of doing smaller chunks from start to finish before starting additional functionality would be good to implement next time.
  - Something that I've found challenging in most grouped projects is setting expectations for style/architecture/etc before the project starts. Everybody has their own particular way of going about things, and I think we are still learning how to adjust to new teammates each time. This can be uncomfortable and time consuming at the beginning of each project.
- What did not go well?
  - We had a lot of work in progress at any given time, which I found difficult to follow and contribute to as I often didn't know where you were at in your work.
  - The original implementation of OAuth2 ended up only partially being paired (this is due in large part to my being unavailable for much of that afternoon, woo pregnancy). I had the expectation that I would come back from the long break and we would program it out together, so when you had already branched off and completed it I was a bit thrown. 
  - I think the side effects of me being pregnant have a negative impact on group projects due to my needing many breaks and sometimes becoming overwhelmed. :(
- What feedback do you have for your teammate(s) that might help them in future projects/on the job?
  - I think you are very good at working on your own, so a good place to practice something would be more communicative and collaborative pair programming. I can struggle with this as well, and I found that working with Michael Evans was a really great way to practice pair programming. Would highly recommend :)

Communication

- What went well?
  - I think we got better at communication as the project went along.
- What could be improved?
  - More communication at the beginning of the project would have helped me greatly.
- What did not go well?
  - I fell off of slack on the weekend without notice.
  - I would have appreciated more frequent updates about where you were in your work, especially at EOD.
- What feedback do you have for your teammate(s) that might help them in future projects/on the job?
  - At least for me, I think erring on the side of over communciation at the beginning of a project would be good to practice. It seems easier to tone down the communication than ramp it over, and clarity really helps a project move along. One thing I learned is that I would benefit from communicating that to future teammates!

Other

- I *really* appreciated your thoughtful response to my message about being overwhelmed after the weekend. It made me feel like I was in a safe environment, and it helped me get back on track. Thank you!

Process

- What went well?
  - We accomplished the majority of the project scope, with reasonable testing and with a solid organizational structure. 
  - We adjusted to changing schedule demands
- What could be improved?
  - With this many classes, services, etc., diagramming a high level design would have been a good idea. Also deploying more regularly to Heroku for bug testing, etc.
  - There wasn’t a clear scope of work throughout the project duration.
- What did not go well?
  - Not enough communication. 
  - Too many irons in the fire at once.Finish something completely before moving on to the next. 
- What feedback do you have for your teammate(s) that might help them in future projects/on the job?
  - Let me know ahead of time about your schedule. It’s hard to pair if we’re not regularly available at the same time. When I didn't hear from you, I felt like I needed to keep moving on with the project. 

Communication

- What went well?
  - We were quick to respond to questions/comments on PRs, bugs that we discovered, etc. 
- What could be improved?
  - Lack of regular status check-ins led to a bit of a vacuum on direction. It didn’t lead to redundant work efforts, but it did lead to misgivings and communication pitfalls. 
- What did not go well?
  - I often felt that the work I delivered did not meet my partners expectations, both in the scope of what I had worked on and the quality of the code. 
  - Lots of miscommunications! We never got in sync on meeting together, which led to further miscommunications about work load, status updates, etc. 
- What feedback do you have for your teammate(s) that might help them in future projects/on the job?
  - Neither of us did a good job of regularly communicating. I would say try to share schedule constraints in the DTR, or as soon as you know. There were a few instances where project work time had to be rescheduled at the 11th hour.
  - This project was a difficult process. Not having scheduled check-ins made it difficult to regularly catch up on our work progress. Not having a consistent schedule made it difficult to both work together and to clarify what we’re working on independently.
